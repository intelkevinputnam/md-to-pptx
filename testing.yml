      The Intel GPU plugin supports the following devices:

      * Integrated GPUs within Intel® Core™ and Intel® Xeon® processors
      * Intel® Visual Compute Accelerator (Intel® VCA)
      
      There are two primary use cases: one is hardware vendor-independent and uses the Intel Media SDK, and the other uses OpenCL™ code tuned for high end Intel devices. For example, the Intel Media SDK can offload video transcoding operations or the OpenCL™ libraries can provide computation acceleration for Intel GPUs.
